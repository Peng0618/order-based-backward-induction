This repository contains the code for the research paper ["A Mathematical Approach to Design Verification Strategies That Incorporate Corrective Activities as Dedicated Decisions"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9956024).

To run this code, please follow these steps:
1. Install MATLAB (the recommended version is R2018a)
2. Install the package [Bayes Net Toolbox for Matlab](https://github.com/bayesnet/bnt)
3. Install MATLAB Engine API for Python
    - [Install MATLAB Engine API for Python](https://ww2.mathworks.cn/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html)
    - [Start and Stop MATLAB Engine for Python](https://ww2.mathworks.cn/help/matlab/matlab_external/start-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html)
4. Download this repository and change all the directories 'D:\GoogleDrive\PythonScripts\JVS\MatlabCode' in the Bayes net file (e.g., “BNet_small_model.py”) to your corresponding directories.
5. Run the test code “run_DPMethod.py”.
